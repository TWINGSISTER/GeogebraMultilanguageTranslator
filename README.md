# Geogebra (GGB) Multi-language Translator
This repo offers a couple of online services to modify Geogebra (GGB) .ggb files. The repository contains all the 
code to run these services.
The main service provides a  Geogebra javascript package to create a multilanguage version of your ggb activities.
[Try this package here](https://twingsister.github.io/GeogebraMultilanguageTranslator/indexGGBver.html).
You can find an example of the resulting GGB activity [here](example.html) 
that is taken from [here](href="http://www.lycee-valin.fr/maths/exercices_en_ligne/moodle.html).
A proof of concept video is [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A8KA8vFJ0YQ)

In the link you will find different demo systems based on different Geogebra 5.0 versions.
You can set up your self hosted version of this Multi-language translator by copying the HTML
in index-somestring.html  you can find in the root directory of this repo.
You can upgrade your installation to the last Geogebra 5.0 build that is found [here](https://download.geogebra.org/package/geogebra-math-apps-bundle).
I maintain an archive of a few of these GGB bundles [here](https://github.com/TWINGSISTER/Geogebra-Javascript-Bundle) just in the case that you find yourself in a lesson and your applet do not work anymore.
Download a bundle and then unzip into the Geogebra folder so that you have the file 
Geogebra\geogebra-math-apps-bundle-5-0-nnn-x\GeoGebra\deployggb.js. 
Then do some editing to  point your index.html to it. 
If you run into problems and you really need a personal copy of these services just fork this repo!
