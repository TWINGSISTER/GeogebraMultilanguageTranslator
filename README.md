In the link you will find different demo systems based on different Geogebra 5.0 versions.
You can set up your self hosted version of this Multi-language translator by copying the HTML

You can upgrade your installation to the last Geogebra 5.0 build that is found [here](https://download.geogebra.org/package/geogebra-math-apps-bundle).
I maintain an archive of a few of these GGB bundles [here](https://github.com/TWINGSISTER/Geogebra-Javascript-Bundle) just in the case that you find yourself in a lesson and your applet do not work anymore.
Download a bundle and then unzip into the Geogebra folder so that you have the file 
Geogebra\geogebra-math-apps-bundle-5-0-nnn-x\GeoGebra\deployggb.js. 
Then do some editing to  point your index.html to it. 
If you run into problems and you really need a personal copy of these services just fork this repo!
