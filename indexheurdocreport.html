    <h3 style="text-align: justify;">The reporter Service</h3>
    <p>This service transform&nbsp; a set of ggb files adding GGB code to
      snapshot activity at a certain stage. These snapshots could be added
      automatically, when some watched variables changes during student's
      activity, or&nbsp; by user request. The snapshots are stuffed into the GGB
      file when you save it or can be written onto an HTML file. The snapshot
      thus added helps to give consistent reporting when grading multi-step
      activities in Moodle using automatic grading. The Moodle plugin <a href="https://github.com/TWINGSISTER/moodle-mod_geogebra"
        target="_blank">moodle-mod_geogebra</a> takes care to store these <i>augmented</i>
      .ggb(s) and the forked version of plugin <a href="https://github.com/TWINGSISTER/moodle-grade-extended"
        target="_blank">moodle-grade-extended</a> offer a way to produce a
      detailed<i> electronic</i> report (in PDF) for a class. This report
      could&nbsp; list all the snapshots for all the steps for all the exercises
      in a class. This huge documentation is still required sometimes by (rather
      dull) school management policies in order to provide evidence for your
      notes. Providing all this printed on paper simply takes a print command
      onto the PDF file and a good deal of disturbing environmental
      un-awareness.</p>
    <p>An example of this service is running <a href="https://twingsister.github.io/GeogebraMultilanguageTranslator/index-private-687-wreporter.html"
        target="_blank">here</a> and an example of a GGB activity with added
      reporting capability can be found <a href="https://twingsister.github.io/GeogebraMultilanguageTranslator/examplereport.html"
        target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
    <h3 style="text-align: justify;">How to tailor report snap-shooting&nbsp;
      for your Geogebra Activity.</h3>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">When you start the service that adds
      reporting to your GGB activity you see a minimal GUI&nbsp; to enter some
      parameters before pressing the "Add reporting".</p>
    <div style="text-align: center;"><img src="ReportingGUI.jpg" style="width: 966px; height: 439px;"></div>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">On the lower part there is a check for
      adding code that compress the deltas between two snap images. Usually
      reporting takes some space and grows the .ggb size. Compressing is
      supported but it slows down the GGB activity and the space requirements
      for these activities are not so demanding, YMMV. </p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">The Libraries field is a percent (%)&nbsp;
      separated list of URL. The URL are not downloaded and inserted into the
      output code. They are passed as references that will be downloaded when
      the activity runs. If you use HTTP URL for the libraries there will be no
      problem. On the other hand, the relative path used in the figure requires
      that these packages are on the server where the produced GGB is.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">The other four lines "Watch for
      iteration|error|ok" are a hash (#) separated lists of identifiers possibly
      followed by a&nbsp; number like in numexo%40#Bouton1%40. This number
      defines a "overrun limit" for this activity.&nbsp; </p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">The package takes care to insert code that
      watch any change in the given variables.&nbsp; If the given variable do
      not exist it is simply ignored. Therefore you can keep together lists for
      several activities.&nbsp;</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">In general when one of these object changes
      a snapshot is taken. If you snapshoot&nbsp; twice the same situation a
      useless double copy will not be recorded. However to avoid taking too many
      shots we stop taking pics when the&nbsp; "iterations" goes beyond the sum
      of "ok"s and&nbsp; "errors" of the given overrun limit. </p>
