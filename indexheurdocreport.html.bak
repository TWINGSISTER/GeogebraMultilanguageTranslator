    <h3 style="text-align: justify;">How to tailor report snap-shooting&nbsp;
      for your Geogebra Activity.</h3>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">When you start the service that adds
      reporting to your GGB activity you see a minimal GUI&nbsp; to enter some
      parameters before pressing the "Add reporting".</p>
    <img src="file:///Z:/PortableApps/home/git/GeogebraMultilanguageTranslator/ReportingGUI.jpg"
      alt="">
    <p style="text-align: justify;">On the lower part there is a check for
      adding code that compress the deltas between two snap images. Usually
      reporting takes some space and grows the .ggb size. Compressing is
      supported but it slows down the GGB activity and the space requirements
      for these activities are not so demanding, YMMV. </p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">The Libraries field is a pipe | separated
      list of URL. The URL are not downloaded and inserted into the output code.
      They are passed as references that will be downloaded when the activity
      runs. If you use HTTP URL for the libraries there will be no problem. On
      the other hand, the relative path used in the figure requires that these
      packages are on the server where the produced GGB is.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">The other four lines "Watch for
      iteration|error|ok" are a comma separate list of identifier possibly
      followed by a pipe and a number like in numexo|40,Bouton1|40. This number
      defines a "overrun limit" for this activity.&nbsp; </p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">The package takes care to insert code that
      watch any change in the given variables.&nbsp; If the given variable do
      not exist it is simply ignored. Therefore you can keep one list for
      several activities.&nbsp;</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">In general when one of these object changes
      a snapshot is taken. If you snap shoot&nbsp; twice the same situation this
      will not be recorded. However to avoid taking too shots we stop taking pic
      when objects watching "iterations" goes beyond the sum of OKs and&nbsp;
      errors of the given overrun limit. </p>
