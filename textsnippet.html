    <title>Traslate GGB activity wording as a text snippet</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <p>Sometimes only a text snippet translator is available i.e. you can only
      paste some text in an half window and have the translation in another half
      window. In this case <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20220526185039/http://www.html-file-translator.de/HFT12.zip"
        target="_blank">this software</a> turns out to be quite handy. You have
      to open&nbsp; your SomeName-FL-XY.html file and File&gt;Export it to
      SomeFolder. This will create in SomeFolder a SomeName-FL-XY.txt file and a
      SomeName-FL-XY.vexp file. Simply open the .txt file copy the content
      of&nbsp; it and paste it to some text snippet translator. Revise the
      proposed translation&nbsp; and save the text translation into a&nbsp; new
      SomeName-FL-XY_ZY.txt file. Then go to File&gt;Import and in the mask
      point the new .txt file SomeName-FL-XY_ZY.txt and the .vexp file
      SomeName-FL-XY.vexp. Put the result in a new SomeName-FL-XY_ZY.html file.
      This will build the translation needed by GGB to add ZY language to the
      multi-language version of the SomeName GGB activity.</p>
